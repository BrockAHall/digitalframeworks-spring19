Unlike previous US Presidents, Trump did not divest from his businesses before assuming office. Ethics organizations have as a consequence raised questions about how he may be benefiting financially from his presidency. We can't track all payments to his businesses, but due to campaign finance reporting requirements, we can track ones made by candidates or PACS. Here [tktk] is a csv of every expenditure from entities tracked by the FEC to any entity including the name "Trump" or "Mar-A-Lago".

Based on this data, write a ~300 word story about campaigns and Mr. Trump's businesses. You must include some aggregate statistics beyond just the total amount paid.

Please do your calculations in a google sheet and link the sheet at the bottom of your story.
