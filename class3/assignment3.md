# Assignment 3: Cleaning data

1. Find a "large" dataset (6+ columns, 100+ rows) that would require cleaning before you can analyze it. 
2. Save an original copy of the data as a `.csv` file
3. Use the techniques you learned in class (and the power of Google) to clean the data, while documenting _each_ action you take. 
4. Save the clenaed data as a second `.csv` file.

Turn in both `.csv` files, as well as the documentation as a `.md` file in a new folder on Github called `assignment3`.
