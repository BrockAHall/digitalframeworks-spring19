# Digital Frameworks Summer 2018

## Details

**Instructor**: Sean McMinn

**Contact**: seanpm92@gmail.com for fastest response

**Class time**: 6pm-9pm, Wednesdays

**Office hours**: By appointment

**Syllabus and assignments**: TKTK

**Description**: The goal of this class is to give you a background for telling stories using data and technology as reporting tools. By the end of this class, you should be able to find datasets relevant to a story you're reporting, process and clean them up, use those datasets to answer questions, understand the limitations and caveats of a dataset, and tell a story using data.

## Policies

### Expectations

* Come to class or let me know if you can't make it
* Complete in-class exercises either in class or as homework due before the next class. Late assignments will not be accepted. They are in-class assignments, turning them in before the next class is already a one-week grace period.
* Submit assignments on github (instructions in first lecture) as specified in the assignment.
* Consume the news every week, and come to class with at least 1 story using data. I will randomly select several people to share a story at the beginning of class, so please have a link ready to go.
* Complete a final project, which will be a 800-1000 word story with graphics, based substantially on data. This includes a brief memo due halfway through the quarter giving me a status update about what you intend to focus on.
* Unless otherwise specified, assignments including the final project should be written in complete sentences and paragraphs (not fragments, notes or bulletpoints)

Note that there will not be stand-alone homework outside of the in-class exercises which are due before the next class.

### Grading

Your grade will be made up of three components:

* 20%: Class attendance and participation, including presenting data stories when I call on you to do so
* 50%: In-class assignments (if you do not finish them or do not make it to class, you need to do these as homework)
* 30%: Final project, including a midterm checkin

### Collaboration

Students are encouraged to discuss assignments. For the most part, you will be working on different things, so talking about your work should not be a problem. Whiteboarding your way through a sticky problem with a friend or looking online for answers to technical questions are encouraged (programmers do that all the time!). Your final work, however, must be entirely your own. A good rule of thumb is that no one else should take over your keyboard while completing an assignment.
