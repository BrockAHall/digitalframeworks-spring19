# Assignment 5

Your editor just noticed campaign finance reports for the past quarter are out and thinks the readers will be interested in a story based on the filings. Poke around and find something interesting, relevant or fun, and write a pitch. Include some examples (could be a list or table) of specifics you'd like to include.

You can pick any subject area (does not have to be your actual subject area of preference).

Your pitch should be at least 300 words.

## How 'bout an example?

Some interesting examples from a previous quarter:

* Which Real Housewives (or NFL owners) gave to which candidates in 2017?
* How much did the local congressperson raise? How did that compare to the challenger? What were their major expenditures?
* Find a SuperPAC that raised a lot of money (or that is relevant to your beat). Who gave, and what was the money spent on?
