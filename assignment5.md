# Assignment 5

Find a dataset that interests you and make a graphic using google sheets, quartz charbuilder or datawrapper. Embed or link your graphic in a github file titled `assignment5.md`. In that file, you should include about 300 words that complement your graphic.

## Notes

* Your graphic should be a line, bar or scatter chart. You will be evaluated on whether you made a reasonable choice based on your data

* The text should complement the graphic, it should neither describe the graphic nor describe how you made the graphic. Things you might want to include are details about the dataset that convince the reader it is trustworthy, context about the graphic you've made, or specific data points you think warrent more explanation or emphasis.

* Datawrapper is very nice for embedding on other sites or CMS's, so if that's something you frequently do, that might be what you want to use. It does not play well with github. If you use datawrapper, please include a link to your graphic, and I will click it.

* If you use google sheets or quartz chartmaker, you can download a version of your graphic from the service. Upload that as a separate file to github. You can add the image directly to your assignment using the following code:

`![title for your chart](link to your chart right here on github)`

NOTE carefully the `!` at the beginning of that line!!!

Here's a real example with a chart I made:
