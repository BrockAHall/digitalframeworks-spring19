# Github and Markdown

## Why Github?

For this class, your homework needs to be turned in on Github. Why? Because Github is how many folks who work with code and data share things. The goal of this assignment is to get you to a point where you can comfortably find and share things on github if that's what your collaborators are using. So by the end of this quarter:

* You should be able to commit files to github
* You should be able to find someone else's code/data on github if they direct you to it
* You will have a github profile and a few samples of your own work available on github, showing that you know how to use it

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is a markup language that plays particularly well with github, producing nice, readable documents (like this one!). Since most of our assignments will involve writing, you'll submit them using markdown.

## Assignment

### to be submitted before the start of the next class

1. Create a Github account. Add your account name to this google sheet (tktktk) so I know where to find your homework.
1. Create a repository called *digitalframeworks*. You will submit all your homework there.
1. Find one story from the past week (or so) that has a data component. It can be a visual, graphic, video or text story. Write 300 words about your thoughts on the story. You should write in complete English sentences and paragraphs, and you may use the first person. The kinds of things you might want to include are:
   * How did they use the data?
   * Can you tell where the data came from? Did they link to the source?
   * Was there anything about the story that was unclear?
   * What did you like about the story?
   * What are you still wondering about?
1. Include at least the following features in your writeup, to show you know how to use markdown:
   * A heading
   * A list or table
   * Hyperlinked text
1. Submit this assignment in your digitalframeworks repository as assignment1.md.
1. I strongly encourage you to complete this assignment in class. Submitting the first assignment is the hardest, and I'm here to help if you do it in class. I can't help you if you email me 20 minutes before deadline.
