# Defending a data source

Come up with an interesting question you'd like to ask, and find a real-world data set that you think will answer the question for you.

Now imagine you bring it up with your editor, and she asks you to defend the authority of the data. Write her a 300 word email including the specific things you have checked and steps you have taken to ensure your story won't need to be corrected.

Your response should include a link to your dataset and the question you are hoping to answer. Do NOT write a pitch or a full story (you don't even need to have a final answer to your original question).
