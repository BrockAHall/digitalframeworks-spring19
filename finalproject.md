# final project details

You must complete a final project for this class. The project has three components:
1. A 1000 word story based substantially on a dataset, due at or before 6PM on May 30 (IMPORTANT: This is the 2nd to last class!!!).
1. A two-minute pitch of said story, to be delivered on May 9.
1. In the final class, a fellow student will interview you about the piece (this is why the project needs to be turned in by May 30, so they can prepare).

The 1000 word piece should answer an interesting question using data. The data component of the story must be substantial, and you need to dig into the dataset. If you just read toplines off a website without actually finding and downloading or creating a dataset, that is insufficient.

For the interview component, I’m looking for something like what CNN or NPR regularly does when they bring the author of an interesting story in to give some details. The interviewee must be prepared with 3 or 4 questions, and the interviewer needs to be prepared to go into detail about the story and the reporting behind it.

The final project is all together worth 30% of your grade. It will break down as follows:

* 5% for pitch
* 15% for written story
* 5% for your role as interviewer (on someone else’s topic)
* 5% for your role as interviewee


Examples of successful final projects from last term included:
* What is floating around in the Pacific Ocean based on data from Ocean Conservancy’s international cleanup
* How did skatbacks (smaller running backs) perform vs running backs as a whole, based on a dataset collected by the student
* How does the number of women running for congress correlate with the number of women who vote, historically (required combining two separate datasets).
